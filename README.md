Employee Attrition: Investigating Why Workers Quit

The project seeks to uncover the factors driving attrition at IBM by applying a diverse set of 
statistical learning techniques to a rich HR dataset. 

Supervised learning models: logistic regression, LASSO, random forest, decision trees, and support vector 
machines, were trained to predict employee attrition.
Unsupervised learning models: principal component analysis, multiple correspondence analyses, t-SNE visualization 
and density-based clustering.
